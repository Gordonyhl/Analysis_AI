Phase 1: Foundation & Basic FastAPI Setup
Goal: Get a simple web server running with basic endpoints
Set up development environment
Install Python, FastAPI, uvicorn
Create basic project structure
Get "Hello World" FastAPI server running
Create basic data models
Define Pydantic models for RNA-seq data (simple count table structure)
Create models for user sessions
Practice with basic validation
Build simple file upload endpoint
Single endpoint that accepts CSV files
Basic file validation (check if it's CSV, has expected columns)
Return success/error messages
Milestone: You can upload a file via API and get a response


Phase 2: Database Integration & Data Persistence
Goal: Store and retrieve data from PostgreSQL
Set up PostgreSQL database
Install PostgreSQL locally
Create basic tables (users, sessions, uploaded_files)
Learn basic SQL operations
Integrate database with FastAPI
Use SQLAlchemy for database operations
Create database models matching your Pydantic models
Build endpoints to save/retrieve session data
Enhance file upload
Save uploaded file metadata to database
Store actual file contents (start with small files in database)
Create endpoint to list previous uploads
Milestone: Upload files and see them persisted in database
Phase 3: Basic R Integration
Goal: Execute simple R scripts from Python
Start with subprocess approach (easiest)
Create a simple R script that reads CSV and outputs basic stats
Call R script from Python using subprocess
Parse R script output back to Python
Create R analysis endpoint
FastAPI endpoint that triggers R analysis
Pass uploaded data to R script
Return results to frontend
Handle R errors gracefully
Catch R script errors
Return meaningful error messages to user
Milestone: Upload data → trigger R analysis → get results
Phase 4: Basic Frontend & WebSocket
Goal: Simple web interface with real-time communication
Create basic HTML frontend
Simple upload form
Results display area
Serve static files from FastAPI
Add WebSocket for real-time updates
Basic WebSocket endpoint in FastAPI
Send progress updates during R analysis
Display live updates on frontend
Connect all pieces
Upload → save to DB → trigger R → stream results via WebSocket
Milestone: Complete flow from upload to results with live updates
Phase 5: AI Integration Basics
Goal: Add simple AI conversation capability
Integrate basic LLM
Start with OpenAI API or local model
Create simple chat endpoint
Store conversation history in database
Connect AI to data context
Pass analysis results to AI for interpretation
Generate simple summaries of RNA-seq results
Return AI responses via WebSocket
Basic agent behavior
AI can answer questions about uploaded data
Simple decision making (which analysis to run)
Milestone: AI can chat about your RNA-seq data and suggest analyses
Phase 6: Enhanced Analysis & Agent Orchestration
Goal: Multiple AI agents working together
Create specialized agents
Data validation agent
Analysis planning agent
Results interpretation agent
Add LangGraph for agent orchestration
Define simple workflows between agents
Agent-to-agent communication
Structured decision trees
Expand R script library
Multiple analysis types (DESeq2, basic plots)
Dynamic parameter passing to R scripts
Milestone: Multiple AI agents collaborating on analysis
Phase 7: Advanced Features & Polish
Goal: Interactive visualizations and advanced capabilities
Upgrade frontend to React + Plotly
Interactive plots generated from R
Plot customization via natural language
Better UI/UX
Advanced AI capabilities
External knowledge integration (PubMed searches)
Hypothesis generation
Complex reasoning chains
Containerization
Docker containers for R environment
Reproducible analysis environment
Milestone: Full-featured prototype ready for GitHub
Key Learning Principles:
Start simple: Each phase should work end-to-end before moving to the next
Test frequently: Make sure each component works before adding complexity
Use existing tools: Don't reinvent the wheel (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
Focus on one thing at a time: Master each technology before combining them

Recommended First Steps:
Get FastAPI "Hello World" running
Create a simple file upload endpoint
Test with a small CSV file
Only move to Phase 2 when Phase 1 is solid
